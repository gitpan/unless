NAME
    unless - use a Perl module unless a condition holds

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

DESCRIPTION
    The construct

      use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

    has no effect if "CONDITION" is true. In this case the effect is the
    same as of

      use MODULE ARGUMENTS;

    Above "=>" provides necessary quoting of "MODULE". If not used (e.g., no
    ARGUMENTS to give), you'd better quote "MODULE" yourselves.

BUGS
    The current implementation does not allow specification of the required
    version of the module.
