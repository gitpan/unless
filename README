NAME
    unless - use a Perl module unless a condition holds

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
      use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

DESCRIPTION
    The construct

      use unless CONDITION, MODULE => ARGUMENTS;

    has no effect if "CONDITION" is true. In this case the effect is the
    same as of

      use MODULE ARGUMENTS;

    Above "=>" provides necessary quoting of "MODULE". If not used (e.g., no
    ARGUMENTS to give), you'd better quote "MODULE" yourselves.

BUGS
    The current implementation does not allow specification of the required
    version of the module.

SEE ALSO
    if provides the same functionality as this module, without the negation.
    It is also in core (since version 5.6.2).

    Module::Requires can be used to conditionally load one or modules, with
    constraints based on the version of the module.

    Module::Load::Conditional provides a number of functions you can use to
    query what modules are available, and then load one or more of them at
    runtime.

    provide can be used to select one of several possible modules to load,
    based on what version of Perl is running.
